# DMIT – Premium Optimized VPS Provider for Stable Global Connectivity

---

Looking for a VPS that actually delivers on speed and stability? DMIT specializes in premium-tier VPS hosting with optimized network routes (CN2 GIA, CMIN2, 9929) across Los Angeles, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Whether you're running cross-border e-commerce, hosting websites, or need reliable low-latency connections, DMIT's AMD EPYC processors and NVMe storage handle it without breaking a sweat. Plus, they offer free IP changes every 15 days for most optimized routes—something competitors charge $8.79 per change for.

## Who is DMIT?

DMIT (affectionately nicknamed "Auntie" in Chinese communities) launched in 2017 and quickly became known for not messing around with hardware specs or network quality. They're actually one of the upstream providers for the famous Bandwagon Host, which tells you something about their infrastructure game.

## Why People Actually Choose DMIT

**Top-tier hardware that doesn't throttle you**  
AMD EPYC processors paired with NVMe SSDs mean your VPS isn't going to choke when traffic spikes hit. The kind of setup where you don't sit there wondering if the CPU is from 2015.

**Network routes that actually work**  
Core nodes in LA, Hong Kong, and Tokyo with CN2 GIA, CMIN2, and 9929 optimized routes. For users in China connecting to overseas services (or vice versa), this translates to connections that don't feel like you're sending messages via carrier pigeon.

**Stability you can set your watch to**  
Their US West CN2 products run almost flat on monitoring graphs. That's not marketing speak—that's what happens when someone actually cares about uptime. They back it with 99% SLA guarantees.

**Flexible configs for different needs**  
Whether you're testing something small or running actual production workloads, they've got options that scale without forcing you into plans you don't need.

The refund policy is refreshingly honest: full refund within 3 days (under 30GB usage), or pro-rated refund within 30 days. And that free IP change every 15 days? That's the kind of detail that matters when you're managing international connectivity.

## Los Angeles VPS Options

### Premium Series (CN2 GIA Return Routes—The Good Stuff)

This is DMIT's flagship product line. Three-network CN2 GIA return routing means guaranteed optimized paths, not "best effort" nonsense.

- **LAX.Pro.WEE**: 1C1G20G 500G (500Mbps) - $39.9/year [Currently sold out]
- **LAX.Pro.MALIBU**: 1C1G20G 1T (1Gbps) - $49.9/year [Currently sold out]

- **LAX.Pro.PalmSpring**: 2C2G40G 2T (2Gbps) - $100/year [Currently sold out]
- **LAX.Pro.POCKET**: 2C2G40G 1.5T (4Gbps) - $14.9/month, $159.98/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

One of the best optimized US West routes you'll find, with stability that looks almost boring on graphs—which is exactly what you want. Nearly flat line performance all day.

### Eyeball Series (9929 & CMIN2 Routes—Best Effort Optimization)

China Telecom/Unicom get 9929, China Mobile gets CMIN2. Not as pampered as Premium but still solid for most use cases.

- **LAX.EB.INTRO**: 1C1G10G 500G (1Gbps) - $29.9/year [Currently sold out]
- **LAX.EB.WEE**: 1C1G20G 1T (1Gbps) - $39.9/year [Currently sold out]
- **LAX.EB.CORONA**: 1C1G20G 2T (2Gbps) - $49.9/year [Currently sold out]
- **LAX.EB.TINY**: 1C2G20G 1.5T (2Gbps) - $9.9/month, $88.88/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)
- **LAX.EB.FONTANA**: 2C2G40G 4T (4Gbps) - $100/year [Currently sold out]
- **LAX.EB.POCKET**: 2C2G40G 3T (4Gbps) - $14.9/month, $159.98/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)
- **LAX.EB.STARTER**: 2C2G80G 5T (10Gbps) - $29.9/month, $322.99/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

**Test it yourself**: [Looking Glass](https://lg.dmit.sh/?server=2)

![DMIT Eyeball series network performance monitoring](image/69599686410.webp)

The Eyeball series trades a bit of optimization for lower pricing. Telecom is slightly behind Premium, but Unicom and Mobile get their respective top-tier optimized routes. If Telecom also ran CN2 GIA here, it would undercut Premium pricing, so this is clearly a strategic positioning choice.

### Premium Secure Series (CloudFlare Ingress + CN2 GIA Return, 5T DDoS Protection)

When you need both optimization AND protection—a rare combo that usually costs an arm and a leg elsewhere.

- **LAX.sPro.Fixed**: 2C2G40G 1T (300Mbps) - $139/year [Currently sold out]
- **LAX.sPro.CREATOR**: 2C2G20G 1.5T (100Mbps) - $71.99/quarter, $259.99/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

High-defense PLUS optimized routes is usually code for "expensive as hell" (see: Spartan Host pricing). CloudFlare handles inbound traffic with DDoS protection, while CN2 GIA takes care of return routes. The 5T protection claim has conditions and might not hit that ceiling in practice, but the overall protection is still impressive for this product tier.

**Update 9/30**: This product line is being phased out—grab it while you still can if interested.

## Tokyo VPS Options

### Premium Series (CN2 GIA Return Routes—Top Tier Japan Optimization)

- **TYO.Pro.Shinagawa**: 1C2G60G 500G (500Mbps) - $199/year [Currently sold out]
- **TYO.Pro.TINY**: 1C1G20G 500G (1Gbps) - $21.9/month, $262.8/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)
- **TYO.Pro.STARTER**: 1C2G40G 1T (1Gbps) - $39.9/month, $478.8/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

**Test it yourself**: [Looking Glass](https://lg.dmit.sh/?server=8)

![DMIT Tokyo CN2 network performance showing premium optimization](image/448346102581034.webp)

The absolute top tier for Japan-optimized routes. Yes, the price matches the "top tier" label, but you're getting what you pay for here.

### Eyeball Series (Three-Network CMI Direct Return—Best Effort)

- **TYO.EB.WEE**: 1C1G20G 1T (1Gbps) - $189/year [Currently sold out]
- **TYO.EB.TINY**: 1C1G20G 1T (1Gbps) - $25.9/month, $310.8/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)
- **TYO.EB.STARTER**: 1C2G40G 2T (2Gbps) - $55.9/month, $670.8/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

China Mobile performs great. Telecom and Unicom experience some QoS throttling due to cross-carrier CMI routing, so speeds aren't as stellar.

## Hong Kong VPS Options

### Premium Series (CN2 GIA Return Routes—Premium Hong Kong Optimization)

- **HKG.Pro.VICTORIA**: 1C2G60G 800G (500Mbps) - $298.88/year [Currently sold out]
- **HKG.Pro.TINY**: 1C1G20G 400G (1Gbps) - $39.9/month, $478.8/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

Arguably the most optimized return-to-China routes available. Price reflects the premium positioning, but for users who need Hong Kong specifically with guaranteed routing, this is it.

### Eyeball Series (Three-Network CMI Direct Return)

- **HKG.EB.WEEv2**: 1C1G20G 450G (500Mbps) - $179.9/year [Currently sold out]
- **HKG.EB.TINYv2**: 1C1G20G 1T (1Gbps) - $29.9/month, $358.8/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

China Mobile runs smoothly. Telecom and Unicom hit QoS limitations via CMI cross-carrier routing. Value proposition isn't as strong as Bandwagon's HK85 datacenter (which also uses three-network CMI returns).

## Tier 1 Series VPS (Non-Optimized International Routes)

DMIT's rare non-optimized product line available in LA, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. Not tailored for China mainland connectivity—better suited for Asia-Pacific or US/EU international traffic needs. Traffic is unidirectional with 50-100Mbps speed caps after quota (but unlimited volume).

- **Hong Kong HKG.T1.WEE**: 1C1G20G 1T (4Gbps) - $36.9/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)
- **Tokyo TYO.T1.WEE**: 1C1G20G 1T (4Gbps) - $36.9/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)
- **Los Angeles LAX.T1.WEE**: 1C1G20G 1T (4Gbps) - $36.9/year [Available now](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)

## Bottom Line

DMIT focuses on premium optimized VPS with solid hardware and reliable routes. Their Los Angeles optimized products offer particularly strong value. Pricing runs slightly higher than Bandwagon Host, but you're getting newer hardware, free IP changes, and better incident compensation in return.

Perfect for users who prioritize low latency and high stability—ideal for cross-border e-commerce, website hosting, game acceleration, and small-to-medium business workloads. If you need VPS infrastructure that just works without constant babysitting, [DMIT's optimized routes deliver exactly that](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832).
